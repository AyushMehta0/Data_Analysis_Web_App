## Data Analysis App with Streamlit

This Streamlit web app provides an interactive interface for exploring and analyzing datasets in CSV format. Users can upload their data, preview it, check data types, find the shape (number of rows and columns), identify null values with a heatmap, handle duplicate values, and obtain summary statistics. The app is built with Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and Streamlit.
